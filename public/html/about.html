    <h1>The time when I went to Mauritious....</h1>
    <main>
        <p>I went to mauritious when I was in my ninth standard, for my classical dance performance. It was most memorable moment that I had ever faced in my live that going to mauritious for my performace</p>
        <p>I was there for 7 days. I performaned krishanian theme(Lord Krishna's birth). We performed for 2 days and other 4 days we went to explore mauritious. As This was my first Internaltional performance I was really very happy about that, everything
            was just so miraculous, I was very overwhelmed with this opportunity.</p>
        <p>There we were really appreciated over there, they got to know more about the indian culture. My team was my real support over there. Besides dancing I was able to travel abroad that I dreamt about. All my team went for a tour in mauritious, there
            were many places that we visited, like Elosepe Island, seven wonders of land and many more. We performed many water activities like paragliding, water rafting, boat riding, uner sea walking, etc.</p>
        <p>After coming back also we were interviewed by many news channel and also were appreciated by everyone. For this opportunity I would really like to thanks my parents for enrolling me into classical dance field and helping me to grow.</p>
